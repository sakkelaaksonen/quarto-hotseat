# Quarto 

## My five cents to gaming community

Simple Quarto implementation. Play Quarto with friends on same computer.

## How to play

Read [Quarto Rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarto_%28board_game%29)

**Click** on a game piece to select the next piece to be played.

**Click** on a board cell to place selected piece on the board.

**Click** Quarto button when you want to declare Quarto.

**NOTE**


Players should know who's turn it is. 
Also, unlike most implementations I have seen,in my game you really have to shout (**click**) Quarto. Most games will automatically declare a winner once first quarto is present on the game board. However, this is not in the spirit of the game. So I left it out. Being able to miss a quarto and continuing is essential part of the game IMHO.
